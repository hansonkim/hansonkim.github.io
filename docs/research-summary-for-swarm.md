# Research Summary for Hive Mind Swarm

**Agent**: Researcher
**Task**: Analyze blog structure and recommend search implementation
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: 2025-10-16

## Quick Reference for Other Agents

### What I Found

**Blog Stats**:
- 99 markdown files total
- 2 main blog posts + extensive claude-flow-ko documentation
- Bilingual: Korean + English mixed content
- Eleventy 3.1.2 static site generator
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

**Current Features**:
- Tag-based navigation working
- Tree navigation for nested docs
- No search functionality yet

### What I Recommend

**✅ APPROVED APPROACH: Fuse.js Client-Side Search**

**Why Fuse.js?**
- 6KB bundle (smallest with Korean support)
- Native UTF-8/Korean handling
- Excellent fuzzy matching
- Simple API
- No plugins needed

**Architecture**:
```
Build Time (Eleventy)
  ↓
Generate search-index.json (from all posts)
  ↓
Client-Side (Browser)
  ↓
Load Fuse.js + search index
  ↓
Search happens in browser
```

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Client-side > Server-side**: GitHub Pages is static only
2. **Build-time indexing > Runtime**: More efficient for 99 docs
3. **Fuse.js > Lunr.js**: Better Korean support, simpler
4. **Fuse.js > FlexSearch**: FlexSearch has poor Korean support

### Files in Collective Memory

All agents can access these via `npx claude-flow@alpha memory query`:

- `workers/researcher/blog-structure` - Site structure details
- `workers/researcher/search-requirements` - What search needs to do
- `workers/researcher/tech-stack` - Technology information
- `workers/researcher/content-structure` - Post details
- `workers/researcher/recommended-approach` - Fuse.js recommendation
- `workers/researcher/search-libraries-comparison` - Library analysis

### For the Coder Agent

**What to build**:
1. Search index generation (Eleventy plugin)
2. Search UI component (autocomplete dropdown)
3. Fuse.js integration
4. Mobile-responsive design

**Key files to create**:
- `/src/js/search.js` - Search functionality
- `/src/css/search.css` - Search styles
- Modify: `/src/_layouts/base.njk` - Add search box to header
- Modify: `/.eleventy.js` - Add search index collection

**Libraries needed**:
```bash
npm install fuse.js
```

**Search index structure**:
```javascript
{
  title: "Post Title",
  description: "Brief description",
  content: "Excerpt (300 chars)",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  url: "/posts/post-slug/",
  date: "2025-10-15"
}
```

### For the Tester Agent

**What to test**:
1. Korean text search (including 초성 if possible)
2. English text search
3. Mixed Korean/English queries
4. Fuzzy matching (typos)
5. Tag filtering
6. Mobile responsiveness
7. Keyboard navigation (↑↓ Enter ESC)
8. Accessibility (screen reader)

**Performance targets**:
- Search response < 100ms
- Autocomplete response < 300ms
- Search index load < 500ms
- Bundle size increase < 10KB

### For the Reviewer Agent

**What to review**:
1. Code quality (search.js)
2. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
3. Browser compatibility
4. Performance impact
5. Korean text handling quality
6. Mobile UX

**Key concerns**:
- Search relevance quality
- Mobile keyboard experience
- Korean character handling
- Bundle size impact

## Critical Information

### Don't Change
- Existing blog posts (already have proper front matter)
- Current CSS architecture
- Build pipeline
- Git workflow

### Must Handle
- Korean text (UTF-8)
- English text
- Mixed content
- 99 documents
- Mobile screens 320px+

### Performance Constraints
- GitHub Pages (no server-side processing)
- Bundle size budget: +10KB max
- Search must feel instant (<100ms)

## Questions for Product Owner

1. Should we support initial consonant (초성) search for Korean?
2. What's the priority: accuracy vs speed?
3. Do we need search analytics?
4. Should we show recent/popular searches?
5. What's the mobile UX preference: overlay or inline?
