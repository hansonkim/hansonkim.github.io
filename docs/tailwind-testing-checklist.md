## ‚ö° Performance Testing

### CSS File Size Analysis

**Before Tailwind Integration:**
```bash
# Measure existing CSS
ls -lh src/css/*.css
```

**After Tailwind Integration:**
```bash
# Measure generated CSS (development)
ls -lh _site/css/styles.css

# Measure production build
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
ls -lh _site/css/styles.css
```

**Target Metrics:**
- Development CSS: < 500KB (acceptable with all utilities)
- Production CSS: < 50KB (with purging/minification)
- Reduction goal: > 70% from development to production

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Before | After | Change | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| CSS Size (dev) | - KB | - KB | - | ‚¨ú |
| CSS Size (prod) | - KB | - KB | - | ‚¨ú |
| Page Load Time | - ms | - ms | - | ‚¨ú |
| First Contentful Paint | - ms | - ms | - | ‚¨ú |
| Largest Contentful Paint | - ms | - ms | - | ‚¨ú |
| Total Blocking Time | - ms | - ms | - | ‚¨ú |

### Lighthouse Audit

```bash
# Install Lighthouse CLI
npm install -g lighthouse

# Run audit
lighthouse http://localhost:8080 --view

# Check specific metrics
lighthouse http://localhost:8080 --only-categories=performance --view
```

**Target Scores:**
- Performance: > 90
- Accessibility: > 95
- Best Practices: > 90

## üåê Browser Compatibility

### Desktop Browsers

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)

### Mobile Browsers

- [ ] iOS Safari
- [ ] Chrome Mobile
- [ ] Samsung Internet
- [ ] Firefox Mobile

### Testing Checklist per Browser

- [ ] All styles render correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints work
- [ ] Hover/focus states function
- [ ] Animations are smooth

---

## üîç Style Conflict Detection

### Manual Conflict Check

1. **Inspect Element** on key components
2. Check for multiple conflicting styles:
   ```
   ‚ùå BAD: element has both .custom-button and .btn-primary with conflicting properties
   ‚úÖ GOOD: element uses consistent utility classes
   ```

3. Look for CSS specificity issues:
   ```css
   /* Check for overly specific selectors that override Tailwind */
   .container .card .button { } /* Potential conflict */
   ```

### Common Conflict Areas

- [ ] Custom CSS margins/padding vs Tailwind spacing
- [ ] Flexbox/Grid implementations
- [ ] Typography styles (font-size, line-height)
- [ ] Color definitions
- [ ] Border radius values
- [ ] Shadow definitions

### Resolution Strategy

```css
/* If conflicts exist, use Tailwind utilities or @apply */

/* ‚ùå Old approach */
.custom-button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: blue;
}

/* ‚úÖ New approach - use Tailwind classes */
<button class="px-5 py-2.5 bg-blue-500">

/* OR use @apply in CSS if needed */
.custom-button {
  @apply px-5 py-2.5 bg-blue-500;
}
```

## üß™ Regression Testing

### Visual Regression Checklist

Compare screenshots before and after integration:

- [ ] Homepage hero section
- [ ] Blog post listing page
- [ ] Individual blog post page
- [ ] Archive/category pages
- [ ] Search results page
- [ ] 404 error page

### Functional Regression

- [ ] All links work
- [ ] Navigation functions correctly
- [ ] Search returns results
- [ ] Forms submit properly
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting works
- [ ] Comments (if any) display correctly

---

## üìä Build Process Validation

```bash
# Test all build commands work
npm run css:build      # Should compile Tailwind CSS
npm run css:watch      # Should watch for changes
npm run build          # Should build complete site
npm run dev            # Should start dev environment
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] CSS file generated in `_site/css/`
- [ ] Watch mode detects changes
- [ ] Production build minifies CSS

### Configuration Verification

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js should include:
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{njk,html,js}",
    "./*.{njk,html}"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Checklist:
- [ ] Content paths include all template files
- [ ] Custom theme values (if any) are defined
- [ ] Plugins (if any) are loaded
- [ ] No syntax errors in config
